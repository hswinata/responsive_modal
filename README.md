        * Implements swipe gestures for intuitive slide navigation on mobile devices using functions:
            - `handleTouchStart`: Captures the initial touch position.
            - `handleTouchMove`: Tracks touch movement to determine swipe direction.
            - `handleTouchEnd`: Detects the swipe completion and triggers slide transition based on the direction.
